Hello, nothing special here, just a simple script that is intended to be used when your server has no active EMS online, i was asked for this script by someone, so thought i may as well just upload it here.

All it does is simulate EMS being called, them arriving, giving you treatment and then taking you to the medical centre.

Obviously, it can be changed to use any progress bar you desire.
